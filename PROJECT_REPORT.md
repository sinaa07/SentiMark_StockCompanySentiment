## Problem Statement

### The Problem
Investors and traders in the Indian stock market face significant challenges in processing and analyzing the vast amount of financial news and information available daily. Key problems include:

1. **Information Overload**: With hundreds of financial news articles published daily across multiple sources, manual analysis is impractical and time-consuming.

2. **Sentiment Ambiguity**: Human interpretation of news sentiment is subjective and prone to bias, leading to inconsistent investment decisions.

3. **Real-time Processing**: Traditional analysis methods cannot keep pace with the speed of market-moving news, causing delayed reactions to market events.

4. **Source Reliability**: Not all news sources are equally credible, and filtering relevant information from noise is challenging.

5. **Scalability Issues**: Manual sentiment analysis doesn't scale to cover the entire NSE universe of 3,000+ listed companies.

### Importance
The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated:

- **Market Efficiency**: Automated sentiment analysis contributes to market efficiency by processing information faster than human analysts
- **Risk Management**: Early detection of negative sentiment can help investors manage portfolio risk
- **Investment Decisions**: Data-driven sentiment insights support more informed investment decisions
