"LG India soars past South Korean parent, becomes $13 billion giant after blockbuster debut. In a stunning debut that defied expectations, LG Electronics India surged 50.4% from its IPO price on its first day of trading on Tuesday, taking its market capitalisation to Rs 1.16 lakh crore, or about $13.13 billion, higher than its South Korean parent LG Electronics Inc, which is valued at around $8–9 billion in Seoul.The listing marked the best performance for a billion-dollar IPO in India since 2021, placing the company ahead of peers Whirlpool, Voltas and Havells.Shares of LG India opened at Rs 1,715 on the BSE and Rs 1,710.10 on the NSE, compared with an issue price of Rs 1,140 per share, giving investors a listing-day gain of more than 50%. The rally lifted the company’s market value beyond all other Indian-listed consumer durable peers, including Whirlpool of India ($1.7 billion), Voltas ($5.8 billion) and Havells India ($10.4 billion).The Rs 11,607-crore initial public offering was entirely an offer for sale by LG Electronics Inc. It drew overwhelming investor demand, with total bids exceeding the issue size 54 times. The qualified institutional buyers’ portion was subscribed to 166 times, while retail investors bid 3.5 times their allotted quota.Ahead of the debut, the shares were commanding a 31% premium in the grey market, reflecting strong investor appetite. The robust listing gave LG India the highest listing-day premium of 50.4% among IPOs exceeding Rs 10,000 crore.The debut comes amid India’s second-busiest quarter on record for IPOs, although recent large issues such as WeWork India and Tata Capital posted muted debuts.India’s record with large listings has been uneven. Coal India’s 2010 IPO, which raised Rs 15,199 crore, remains one of the few success stories, listing nearly 40% higher. In contrast, Reliance Power’s 2008 offering listed 17% lower, while Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore IPO in 2021 dropped 27% on debut. Even state-backed giants have struggled, with LIC’s Rs 20,557-crore IPO listing 7.8% lower and GIC Re’s Rs 11,257-crore issue debuting with a 4.6% loss.Against this backdrop, LG India’s performance stands out as a rare exception among India’s mega IPOs, combining both scale and strong investor response.Brokerages turn bullish with record buy callsThe IPO triggered a strong show of analyst confidence, with at least eight brokerages issuing buy ratings within hours, reflecting optimism on LG India’s fundamentals and India’s consumer durables sector.Emkay Global Financial Services led with a Rs 2,050 price target, implying an 80% upside. “LG has, over the last three decades, built a formidable franchise, leading in key large appliance categories with premium positioning, leveraging its global R&D strength, brand power, and superior execution,” Emkay analysts wrote, projecting 13% revenue CAGR and 14% EPS CAGR over FY26–28.Nomura initiated coverage with a buy rating and Rs 1,800 target, forecasting post-tax ROE/ROIC of 31%/56% in FY28F and EBITDA margin expansion from 12.8% in FY25 to ~14.1% in FY28F. ICICI Securities highlighted LG’s “commanding market position” and core return on equity exceeding 90% when adjusted for cash and other income.Other brokerages also turned bullish: Prabhudas Lilladher set a target of Rs 1,780, Ambit Capital Rs 1,820, Motilal Oswal Rs 1,800, Antique Stock Broking Rs 1,725, and Equirus Securities Rs 1,705. Analysts noted LG’s premium segment dominance, growth tailwinds from underpenetration, strong return ratios, and increasing strategic relevance to its Korean parent.Also read | LG share price target at Rs 2,050? Korean giant sparks record frenzy with 8 buy calls on Day 1ICICI Securities pointed out that India’s share of the parent’s revenue rose from 3.5% in CY21 to 4.3% in CY24. Emkay added that under LG’s “Global South” strategy, India is expected to contribute one-third of global growth over five years, while Ambit noted exports could rise from 6% to 10% by FY28 as Sri City plant capacity doubles.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

"At Rs 10,000 crore, Anil Ambani's Reliance Capital recovery may be only 43%. Lenders to Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital are likely to recover just about ₹10,000 crore after the winning bidder, Hinduja Group, declined to significantly improve its offer in the last round of bilateral negotiations that ended on Monday evening, people aware of the development told ET. The recovery, totalling about ₹10,090 crore on factoring in the target company's cash balances and the Hinduja offer, falls short of the ₹12,500-13,000 crore estimated liquidation value. A Hinduja Group entity, IndusInd International Holdings, offered ₹9,650 crore in the extended auction held on April 26. Hinduja improved the offer by only ₹10 crore during the bilateral negotiations, the people cited above said. In addition, the distressed financial services company has around Rs 430 crore as cash balances, which would be distributed among the lenders. This would add up to Rs 10,090 crore, equating to a 43% recovery for verified lenders.Administrator Nageswara Rao Y has admitted Rs 23,666 crore in claims from verified creditors.""Hinduja Group will submit a detailed resolution plan by next week while lenders are in the process of finalising distribution of the proceeds,"" one of the persons cited above said. After this, the administrator will invite lenders to vote on the eligible plans.However, resolution of Reliance Capital will be subject to approval from the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear in August the auction-related dispute between Torrent Investments, a bidder also in the fray in the earlier rounds.  100459497Crucial LIC, EPFO RolesThe stand by LIC, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co on approving the plan will be critical since they are majority debtholders. Yes Bank, an original Reliance Capital lender, sold its debt to JC Flowers ARC. A resolution plan can be approved only if 66% of creditors vote in its favour.Separately, Credit Suisse-led bondholders have decided not to contest a decision by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which directed them to return the custody of Reliance General Insurance shares to the administrator, said the people cited above.This has come as a major relief to the lenders that were worried the resolution might be delayed if Credit Suisse-led bondholders appealed against the tribunal's order.In 2018, Credit Suisse-led investors invested in bonds issued by Reliance Home Finance, a Reliance Capital unit. The home finance company failed to honour the payment on the due date.",Economic Times Business,2023-05-24T00:31:03+00:00,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/at-rs-10000-crore-anil-ambanis-reliance-capital-recovery-may-be-only-43/articleshow/100459486.cms,0.7,RELIANCE
