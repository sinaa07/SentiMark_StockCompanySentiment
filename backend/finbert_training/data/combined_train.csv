"Reliance Jio Adds 12 Million Subscribers in September, ARPU Rises to ₹190. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, reported a robust addition of 12 million net subscribers in September 2025, bringing its total subscriber base to an estimated 498 million. The average revenue per user (ARPU) for Jio increased to ₹190, up from ₹187 in the previous quarter, driven by higher data consumption and tariff adjustments. Analysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their 'Overweight' rating on Reliance Industries, citing strong growth prospects for the digital services segment. The company's aggressive 5G rollout strategy has been a key driver, with 5G services now available in over 7,000 towns and cities across India. This subscriber growth is expected to significantly contribute to Reliance Industries' overall Q2 FY2026 financial performance, which is anticipated later this month. On the NSE, Reliance Industries shares closed at ₹2,910.45, up 0.85% on October 3rd, reflecting positive investor sentiment towards its telecom arm's performance. Promoters continue to hold a significant stake, underscoring long-term commitment to the company's strategic vision.",neutral

"Analysts Maintain 'Buy' on Reliance Industries Ahead of Q2 Results, Target Price ₹3,250. Several leading brokerage firms, including CLSA and Jefferies, have reiterated their 'Buy' rating on Reliance Industries Limited (RELIANCE) on October 1, 2025, ahead of its Q2 FY2026 earnings announcement expected later this month. CLSA maintained a target price of ₹3,250, citing strong performance across its diversified segments, particularly in retail and digital services. Jefferies highlighted potential upside from the O2C business as refining margins are showing signs of recovery, projecting an EBITDA growth of 10-12% for the segment. Analysts anticipate a consolidated revenue growth of approximately 9-10% year-on-year for Q2 FY2026, driven by robust consumer demand. The stock closed at ₹2,873.90 on the NSE, experiencing a marginal dip of 0.25% on October 1st, largely due to broader market consolidation. Institutional investors are closely watching the company's progress in its new energy ventures, which are expected to contribute significantly to future earnings. The consensus view suggests that Reliance's strategic investments in future-growth areas will continue to drive long-term shareholder value. The company's strong balance sheet and deleveraging efforts also remain key positive factors for investor confidence.",neutral

"Reliance Retail Ventures Secures ₹5,000 Crore Investment from Qatar Investment Authority. Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, announced on October 2, 2025, that it has secured a ₹5,000 crore investment from the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). This strategic investment values RRVL at a pre-money equity valuation of ₹8.5 lakh crore, reinforcing its position as India's largest and most profitable retailer. The capital infusion will primarily be utilized to accelerate RRVL's expansion plans, including the acquisition of new brands and further penetration into tier-2 and tier-3 cities. This marks QIA's second major investment in RRVL, following an earlier ₹5,500 crore commitment in 2020. The deal underscores global investor confidence in India's retail sector and Reliance's dominant market leadership. On the BSE, Reliance Industries shares reacted positively, gaining 1.12% to close at ₹2,905.20, with trading volumes seeing a 15% uptick compared to the 30-day average.

"HDFC Bank to Raise ₹20,000 Crore via Bonds for Growth Capital. HDFC Bank's board of directors has approved a significant proposal to raise up to ₹20,000 crore through the issuance of long-term bonds. These bonds will be offered on a private placement basis, aiming to bolster the bank's growth capital. The funds are earmarked to support the bank's ambitious expansion plans, including further increasing its loan book and investing in critical technology infrastructure. This strategic decision was formally announced via a regulatory filing submitted to both the BSE and NSE on October 1, 2025. The bank intends to issue these bonds in multiple tranches over the next 12 months, providing flexibility in its capital management. This proactive capital raise is expected to further strengthen HDFC Bank's capital adequacy ratio and facilitate its aggressive growth strategy across both retail and corporate lending segments. Analysts view this move as a prudent measure to maintain a robust balance sheet amidst rising credit demand in the Indian market.",neutral

"At Rs 10,000 crore, Anil Ambani's Reliance Capital recovery may be only 43%. Lenders to Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital are likely to recover just about ₹10,000 crore after the winning bidder, Hinduja Group, declined to significantly improve its offer in the last round of bilateral negotiations that ended on Monday evening, people aware of the development told ET. The recovery, totalling about ₹10,090 crore on factoring in the target company's cash balances and the Hinduja offer, falls short of the ₹12,500-13,000 crore estimated liquidation value. A Hinduja Group entity, IndusInd International Holdings, offered ₹9,650 crore in the extended auction held on April 26. Hinduja improved the offer by only ₹10 crore during the bilateral negotiations, the people cited above said. In addition, the distressed financial services company has around Rs 430 crore as cash balances, which would be distributed among the lenders. This would add up to Rs 10,090 crore, equating to a 43% recovery for verified lenders.Administrator Nageswara Rao Y has admitted Rs 23,666 crore in claims from verified creditors.""Hinduja Group will submit a detailed resolution plan by next week while lenders are in the process of finalising distribution of the proceeds,"" one of the persons cited above said. After this, the administrator will invite lenders to vote on the eligible plans.However, resolution of Reliance Capital will be subject to approval from the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear in August the auction-related dispute between Torrent Investments, a bidder also in the fray in the earlier rounds.  100459497Crucial LIC, EPFO RolesThe stand by LIC, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co on approving the plan will be critical since they are majority debtholders. Yes Bank, an original Reliance Capital lender, sold its debt to JC Flowers ARC. A resolution plan can be approved only if 66% of creditors vote in its favour.Separately, Credit Suisse-led bondholders have decided not to contest a decision by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which directed them to return the custody of Reliance General Insurance shares to the administrator, said the people cited above.This has come as a major relief to the lenders that were worried the resolution might be delayed if Credit Suisse-led bondholders appealed against the tribunal's order.In 2018, Credit Suisse-led investors invested in bonds issued by Reliance Home Finance, a Reliance Capital unit. The home finance company failed to honour the payment on the due date.",positive

"HDFC Bank Stock Gains 2% After Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates. HDFC Bank's shares experienced a 2% surge on the NSE, closing at ₹1,685.50, after the bank announced its Q2 FY2026 results, which comfortably surpassed analyst expectations. The reported net profit of ₹18,500 crore for the quarter was notably higher than the consensus estimate of ₹18,200 crore. Trading volumes for HDFCBANK surged significantly to 15.2 million shares on the day, considerably above its 30-day average volume of 9 million shares. The bank's management, led by CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, attributed the strong performance to robust retail loan demand and continuous improvements in asset quality. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) reportedly increased their stake marginally in the preceding quarter, signaling sustained confidence in the bank's prospects. The bank's market capitalization now stands at an impressive approximately ₹12.6 lakh crore, solidifying its position as a market leader.",neutral

"LG India soars past South Korean parent, becomes $13 billion giant after blockbuster debut. In a stunning debut that defied expectations, LG Electronics India surged 50.4% from its IPO price on its first day of trading on Tuesday, taking its market capitalisation to Rs 1.16 lakh crore, or about $13.13 billion, higher than its South Korean parent LG Electronics Inc, which is valued at around $8–9 billion in Seoul.The listing marked the best performance for a billion-dollar IPO in India since 2021, placing the company ahead of peers Whirlpool, Voltas and Havells.Shares of LG India opened at Rs 1,715 on the BSE and Rs 1,710.10 on the NSE, compared with an issue price of Rs 1,140 per share, giving investors a listing-day gain of more than 50%. The rally lifted the company’s market value beyond all other Indian-listed consumer durable peers, including Whirlpool of India ($1.7 billion), Voltas ($5.8 billion) and Havells India ($10.4 billion).The Rs 11,607-crore initial public offering was entirely an offer for sale by LG Electronics Inc. It drew overwhelming investor demand, with total bids exceeding the issue size 54 times. The qualified institutional buyers’ portion was subscribed to 166 times, while retail investors bid 3.5 times their allotted quota.Ahead of the debut, the shares were commanding a 31% premium in the grey market, reflecting strong investor appetite. The robust listing gave LG India the highest listing-day premium of 50.4% among IPOs exceeding Rs 10,000 crore.The debut comes amid India’s second-busiest quarter on record for IPOs, although recent large issues such as WeWork India and Tata Capital posted muted debuts.India’s record with large listings has been uneven. Coal India’s 2010 IPO, which raised Rs 15,199 crore, remains one of the few success stories, listing nearly 40% higher. In contrast, Reliance Power’s 2008 offering listed 17% lower, while Paytm’s Rs 18,300-crore IPO in 2021 dropped 27% on debut. Even state-backed giants have struggled, with LIC’s Rs 20,557-crore IPO listing 7.8% lower and GIC Re’s Rs 11,257-crore issue debuting with a 4.6% loss.Against this backdrop, LG India’s performance stands out as a rare exception among India’s mega IPOs, combining both scale and strong investor response.Brokerages turn bullish with record buy callsThe IPO triggered a strong show of analyst confidence, with at least eight brokerages issuing buy ratings within hours, reflecting optimism on LG India’s fundamentals and India’s consumer durables sector.Emkay Global Financial Services led with a Rs 2,050 price target, implying an 80% upside. “LG has, over the last three decades, built a formidable franchise, leading in key large appliance categories with premium positioning, leveraging its global R&D strength, brand power, and superior execution,” Emkay analysts wrote, projecting 13% revenue CAGR and 14% EPS CAGR over FY26–28.Nomura initiated coverage with a buy rating and Rs 1,800 target, forecasting post-tax ROE/ROIC of 31%/56% in FY28F and EBITDA margin expansion from 12.8% in FY25 to ~14.1% in FY28F. ICICI Securities highlighted LG’s “commanding market position” and core return on equity exceeding 90% when adjusted for cash and other income.Other brokerages also turned bullish: Prabhudas Lilladher set a target of Rs 1,780, Ambit Capital Rs 1,820, Motilal Oswal Rs 1,800, Antique Stock Broking Rs 1,725, and Equirus Securities Rs 1,705. Analysts noted LG’s premium segment dominance, growth tailwinds from underpenetration, strong return ratios, and increasing strategic relevance to its Korean parent.Also read | LG share price target at Rs 2,050? Korean giant sparks record frenzy with 8 buy calls on Day 1ICICI Securities pointed out that India’s share of the parent’s revenue rose from 3.5% in CY21 to 4.3% in CY24. Emkay added that under LG’s “Global South” strategy, India is expected to contribute one-third of global growth over five years, while Ambit noted exports could rise from 6% to 10% by FY28 as Sri City plant capacity doubles.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

"NHPC Shares Surge 5% on Strong Q2 Outlook, Analysts Revise Target Price. Shares of NHPC Limited (NSE: NHPC) witnessed a significant rally on October 3, 2025, surging over 5% to close at ₹71.61 on the National Stock Exchange. This upward movement was primarily driven by optimistic analyst reports and a strong outlook for the company's second-quarter performance, following recent project commissioning. Brokerage firm 'HydroPower Analytics' upgraded its rating on NHPC to 'Buy' from 'Hold', citing improved operational metrics and a robust project pipeline. The firm also revised its target price for NHPC to ₹75 per share from the previous ₹68, indicating a potential upside of approximately 4.7% from current levels. Trading volumes for NHPC shares spiked, reaching 30 million shares, significantly higher than its 30-day average, reflecting heightened investor interest. Analysts highlighted factors such as favorable monsoon conditions leading to higher generation, stable power purchase agreements, and the government's continued focus on hydropower as key growth drivers. This positive sentiment underscores investor confidence in NHPC's strategic initiatives and its capacity expansion plans, which are expected to bolster future earnings.",neutral

"Analysts bullish on HDFC Bank post Q2 results, revise target prices. Following HDFC Bank's strong Q2 FY2026 results, several prominent brokerage firms have reaffirmed their 'Buy' ratings and subsequently revised their target prices upwards. Jefferies notably raised its target price for HDFC Bank to ₹2,050 from its previous ₹1,900, citing robust loan growth and improving Net Interest Margins (NIMs) as key drivers. CLSA maintained its 'Outperform' rating, setting a target of ₹1,980, highlighting the bank's consistent asset quality and its strong, well-established deposit franchise. Morgan Stanley also provided a positive outlook, emphasizing the bank's operational efficiency and the anticipated synergy benefits stemming from its recent merger. The average target price across leading brokerages now stands at ₹1,990, suggesting a potential upside of over 18% from the current market levels. During the post-earnings call, the bank's management expressed confidence in achieving its full-year growth targets, reinforcing analyst optimism.",neutral

"NHPC Commissions 240 MW Dibang Multipurpose Project, Boosts Hydropower Capacity. NHPC Limited (NSE: NHPC) officially announced the commissioning of the final 240 MW unit of its Dibang Multipurpose Hydropower Project in Arunachal Pradesh, bringing the project to its full operational capacity. This significant milestone adds a substantial 240 MW to NHPC's total installed generation capacity, reinforcing its position as India's leading hydropower producer. The Dibang project, with an estimated total cost of ₹18,500 crore, is projected to generate approximately 1,200 million units of electricity annually, contributing significantly to the national grid. This expansion is expected to positively impact NHPC's future revenue streams and operational efficiency, aligning with the government's push for renewable energy sources. Following the news, NHPC's stock price on the NSE saw a modest gain of 1.8%, closing at ₹66.15, with increased trading activity. The commissioning was part of a broader strategic initiative to enhance India's clean energy infrastructure, as highlighted by a Ministry of Power official. This development is anticipated to improve NHPC's long-term earnings visibility and attract further institutional investor interest in its green energy portfolio.",neutral
